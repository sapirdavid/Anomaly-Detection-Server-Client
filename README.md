# Anomaly Detection - Server Client

## Introduction

Advanced Programming C++ project - Anomaly Detector.

This project contains the following elements:

- Use of design and architecture templates.
- Communication and client-server architecture.
- Use of data structures.
- Stream data (files and communication).
- Implementation of data-based algorithms within the system we will create.
- Parallel programming using Threads GUI with event-oriented programming.

## Description
Our server contain a Command Line Interface (CLI).
When a client connect, text menus sent by the server will appear.
Through the menu the interaction between the server and the client will take place.
The client will be able to upload a csv file to the server, update parameters of the algorithm and get back an anomaly report that was discovered.
In addition, the client will be able to enter where the actual anomalies occurred and get an analysis of the algorithm accuracy on the data it sent.
Our server will have to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
